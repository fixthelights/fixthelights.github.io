      <description>Hi, this is my first instructable. I&amp;rsquo;m trying this out as it goes, so bear with me. I will try to explain as much as I can, but I do not have enough time or resources for visual representations, and on the topic of that I&amp;rsquo;ll target beginners and intermediate users (like myself) in the field of electrical engineering.
This project focuses on the circuitry and software aspects of a DIY CNC build.</description>
